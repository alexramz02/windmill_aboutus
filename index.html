        <h2>Mike</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>I’m Mike Sangapore – a late 20-something from Milford, CT. I’m originally a musician with a lot of experience touring and recording for various artists all around the country. However, after unfortunate circumstances requiring 5 surgeries in a matter of a couple of years it created a turning point in my life. Because of my physical health, I was unable to pursue music full-time and needed an outlet that I could turn to.</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>That’s when I found real estate and I’ve been hooked ever since. Whether it be the process of buying, selling, or the piece of real estate itself, I find it fascinating how everything comes together.</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>Aside from music and real estate, my true happiness comes from the people I am closest to. I come from a very small family and each day I get to spend with them is a day worth celebrating. I look forward to facing life head on and jumping the inevitable hurdles it will throw my way. There’s not much on this Earth more satisfying than conquering your daily, weekly, and yearly goals and rejoicing in your victories with the ones you love.</h3>

I also love coffee…the aroma, the flavor – I can’t start my day without it!</h3>
